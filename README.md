NEW YORK TIMES FRONT PAGE EMULATION
Thomas Pritchett	12/19/2017
Goal/Problem Statement
Jobs in the front-end Web Development field are abundant for those proficient in basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however becoming fluent in such languages requires time and focus. The goal of my project is to try and recreate the homepage for the New York Times website in order to practice newly gained HTML and CSS skills as well as build some basic back-end functions using JavaScript. 
Measurable Objectives
Recreate New York Times Page Exactly as Pictured
Recreate Header
Create Sections/Search Buttons (using the same styling as pictured on the page)
Create Subscribe Now/Login Buttons using same styling as the page
Create drop down menu to change page language and view help fields (FAQ, Contact Us)
Recreate Logo and Features Bar
Grab logo and scale for use on page
Create Buttons detailing Date, Today’s Paper, Video, Weather, and Stock Information - Date, Weather, and Stock information will be functional 
Create Main Navigation Bar
Create horizontal list of all categories on page that will link directly to the New York Times pages
Create Body of Page
Pick Articles to be coded representing what the page body might look like on a certain day. This will consist of an article title and logo on the left side of the page and two smaller columns on the right.
Create Page Footer

Technical Details
Header
I will start the process of recreating the New York Times home page by using HTML to create the main header at the top of the page and then five active buttons at the top of the page. 
I will position the ‘Sections’ and ‘Search’ buttons  on the left of the page.The ‘Sections’ and ‘Search Buttons’ will have icons to the left of the text identical to the ones on the actual New York Times Page. The ‘Sections’ button will create the side menu when clicked. The ‘Search’ Button will exist but have no functionality.
Next, I will create the ‘Subscribe Now’ and ‘Log In’ Buttons. The ‘Subscribe Now’ and ‘Log In’ buttons will be styled exactly like the buttons on the actual page using basic CSS and will link to the actual New York Times pages associated with each button. 
Lastly, I will create the button on the far right of the page. This button will be a drop down menu allowing change of the page language as well as allowing access to help features. The buttons to change language will have no functionality but will exist, but the ‘FAQ’ and and ‘Contact Us’ buttons will link to the corresponding page on the New York Times website.
Recreate Logo
The logo used in my page will be grabbed from the New York Times homepage and will be used as a centerpiece for the web page exactly as pictured in the New York Times website. 
I will create the menu below the logo detailing Date, Today’s Paper, Video, Weather Information, and Stock Info. The Date, Weather Information, and Stock Information will be made functional using JavaScript and the Today’s Paper and Video sections will link directly to the New York Times website.
Main Navigation Bar
I will create the main navigation menu using a styled ‘Unordered List’ Tag in HTML. Each element of the list will link directly to the page on the New York Times website. 
Body of Page
I will create the body of the page will be hard-coded to look like an example page on the New York Times website might look like. This will be done in many sections to look like the New York Times webpage using both images and hard coded text using paragraph tags in the HTML code. 
Footer
I will create the footer menu by using a styled ‘Unordered List’ tag in HTML. Each element will link directly to the page on the New York TImes website.
